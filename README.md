# Hardhat EVM Project Template

A robust template for developing and deploying Smart Contracts on EVM-compatible blockchains using Hardhat.

## Features

- TypeScript support
- Hardhat configuration ready for multiple networks
- Contract verification setup
- Testing environment
- Gas reporting
- Code coverage
- Solidity style guide enforcement
- Security analysis tools

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)
- npm or yarn

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-name>
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
```

## Project Structure

```bash
├── contracts/          # Smart contracts directory
├── scripts/           # Deployment and interaction scripts
├── test/             # Test files
├── hardhat.config.ts # Hardhat configuration
└── .env              # Environment variables (create this)
```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your configuration:
```bash
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
   ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key
```

2. Configure your networks in `hardhat.config.ts`

## Compiling

```bash
# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile
```

## Testing

Write your tests in the `test/` directory and run:
```bash
   npx hardhat test
```

## Deployment

1. Create your Smart Contracts in the `contracts/` directory
2. Create deployment & verification scripts in the `scripts/` directory
3. Deploy your contract:
```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network <network-name>
```

## Specific Sample - Deploy Example Token
After i configure the network in hardhat.config.ts and add the private key & configured network's api key in .env, i can run the specificSample.ts to deploy the contract and verify the contract
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/specificSample.ts --net
work berachainTestnet
```
And the output will be like this:
```shell

## Security

- Always audit your contracts before deployment
- Use well-tested libraries and patterns
- Consider using tools like Slither and Mythril for security analysis
